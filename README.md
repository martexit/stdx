## Features

- **Minimalist Design**: Focus on simplicity and ease of use.
- **Modular Architecture**: Use only the components you need.
- **Single-Header Files**: Easy to integrate into your projects.
- **Dependency-Free**: No external libraries required.
- **C99 Compliance**: Fully compatible with C99 standards.

## Components

### Array

The Array component provides a dynamic array implementation that allows you to create, manipulate, and manage arrays easily. It supports resizing and provides functions for adding, removing, and accessing elements.

### Filesystem

The Filesystem component simplifies file operations, including reading, writing, and directory manipulation. It also includes features for monitoring filesystem events, making it easier to respond to changes.

### Hashtable

The Hashtable component offers a fast and efficient way to store key-value pairs. It supports various hashing algorithms and collision resolution techniques to ensure optimal performance.

### Logging

The Logging component allows you to log messages with different severity levels. You can easily configure the logging output and format, making it suitable for debugging and monitoring applications.

### Networking

The Networking component provides basic networking functionality, including TCP and UDP communication. It allows you to create client-server applications with minimal setup.

### String Manipulation

The String Manipulation component includes various functions for handling strings, such as concatenation, splitting, and searching. It also provides a StringBuilder for efficient string construction.

### Testing Library

The Testing Library component offers a simple framework for writing and running tests. It includes assertions and test runners to help you ensure your code works as expected.

### Thread Pool

The Thread Pool component manages a pool of threads for executing tasks concurrently. It simplifies multithreading and improves performance in CPU-bound applications.

## Installation

To install **stdx**, download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/martexit/stdx/releases) section. You can simply download the `.h` file and include it in your project.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the Array component:

```c
#include "stdx.h"

int main() {
    Array *arr = array_create(sizeof(int), 10);
    int value = 42;
    array_push(arr, &value);
    printf("Element at index 0: %d\n", *(int *)array_get(arr, 0));
    array_free(arr);
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates creating an array, adding an element, and retrieving it.
